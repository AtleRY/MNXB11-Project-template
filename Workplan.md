MNXB11 Project Workplan - Team G

1. Data Preparation:
Task 1: Find and Download CSV Parsing Library
- Responsible: Atle
- Atle will research and identify a suitable CSV parsing library for C++. Once chosen, he will download and set up the library.
Task 2: Extract and clean raw data
- Responsible: Albin
- Albin will handle the extraction and cleaning of the raw data obtained from the SMHI datasets. This includes converting the data to CSV format and adressing any formatting issues.

2. Data extraction and cleaning:
Task 3: A code for data extraction
- Respnsible: Atle and Albin
- Together we will develop a C++ code to extract the targeted data from the cleaned datasets and store the output in a ROOT 
  TTree.
Task 4: Handle bad data
- Responsible Albin, Atle and Ebbe
- We will collaboratively work on identifying and handling bad data. The goal is to filter out undesirable records and store 
  the cleaned data in ROOT format.
3. Data analysis:
Task 5: Decide on the three analyses
- Responsible: Albin, Atle and Ebbe
- We will collectively decide on three analyses to perform on the datasets. These analyses will contribute to the 
  understanding of the Swedish climate.
4. Histogram creation
Task 6: Create Different Histograms
- Responsible: Albin, Atle and Ebbe
- Based on the chosen analyses, we will create different historgrams using ROOT. The histograms will visualize the results 
  obtained from the analyses.
5. Documentation
Task 7: Documentation
- Responsible: Albin, Atle and Ebbe
- Regularly update the Workplan.md document in the repository to track progress. Use a ChangeLog file to document major code 
  changes. README.md should provide instructions on how to compile, run, and reproduce the results.
Task 8: Project Report
- Responsible: Albin, Atle and Ebbe (Ebbe will do the writing).
- Document the entire project in LaTeX, including goals, results, code descriptions, and plots. Each team member will 
  contribute to specific sections related to their tasks.
